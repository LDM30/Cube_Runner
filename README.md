# Cube_Runner

This is an installer to my cube runner game.

To download, click the green "code" button and then click "download ZIP".

Once it has downloaded, right click the .zip file, click "Extract all", and then "Extract"

You should see a .exe file that says something like "Cube Runner Installer". 

Double click the installer file and you should get a pop up message warning you that there is a virus. 

It only does this because there is no publisher. 

On the pop up window click "More info" and then "Run".

You should then see another pop up window asking you if you want to allow the installer to make changes to your device (In other words do you want this file to install something on your computer).

Click "yes". If you click no, you can always reopen the installer to get the pop up window back. 

The installer will run you through the setup progress and you should see a "Cube Runner" app in your start menu.

Use "a" and "d" to move.
